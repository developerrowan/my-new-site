	<h1>Blog Home Page</h1>
	<h3>Pre-Reqs</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Complete at least the first step in the OOPhp assignment</b></li>
		<li>Understanding of PHP and MySQL (and how they work together)</li>
		<li>Understanding of PHPMyAdmin</li>
		<li>Understanding of OOP, Constructors and Classes in PHP</li>
		<li>Understanding of <b>optional parameters</b></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		In this step we are going to work on the blog pages for the site.
		The blog pages will get their content from the database, so we'll start off by setting it up in PHPMyAdmin.
		We'll also have to create a few other files before we start on the blog home page.
		Up until now, we have used the procedural style of programming in PHP.
		Now we'll start using classes and objects in our code.
		(I debated on whether or not to use inheritance right away, but decided not to, just to keep things simple).
	</p>

	<h3>Setting Up The Database</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Open PHPMyAdmin and create a new database called <b>my-new-site</b></li>
		<li>
			In the 'my-new-site' databse, run the SQL statements <a href="SQL.txt">here</a>.
			You should be able to copy the entire contents of the file and run all the queries at once.
			The SQL queries will create two tables, <b>pages</b> and <b>categories</b>.
			They also insert some 'dummy' data into the database for us.
			We'll discuss the tables and columns in class.
			Note that the 'path' column in the 'pages' is a bit of a mystery now, but it will be used to greatly improve our SEO in the future.
			Note that the SQL script adds two 'test' blog posts, just to give us something to work with.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Add code to the config file to connect to the database</h3>
	<p>
		We'll add some code that connects to the database.
		And since a few of our pages will use this code, we'll put it in the config file.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		Add the following constants to the config file: <b>DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME</b>.
		Note that they will be set to different values on the dev and live environments.
		The code should look like <a href="screen-shots/1-db-settings.png">this</a>.
		For the dev settings, you should be able to use the same values for each of the constants that are in the screen shot.
		Later, we'll set up the database on the live site, at that time you can update the values for connecting the the live database
		</li>
		<li>
			Add <a href="screen-shots/2-db-link-function.png">this</a> code to the bottom of the config file.
			We'll discuss this code in class, but for now just note that the function will initialize the <b>$link</b> variable (which represents our connection to the database),
			if it has not already been initialized.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Create the PageDataAccess class</h3>
	<p>
		Note that our book duplicates a lot of code when it comes to accessing the database.
		We are going to take a turn toward object-oriented PHP now.
		Instead of putting SQL queries directly in our web pages (as the book does),
		we will put all SQL queries regarding blog pages into a class. 
		This will make our code more flexible, re-usable, maintainable, modular, and testable.
		When we add a new page to our site that needs to access the database, we'll use this class rather than duplicate the code in each page.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
			Create a file in the <b>includes</b> folder called <b>PageDataAccess.inc.php</b>.
			Note that the file name starts with a capital P, which indicates that this is a class.
			<a href="page-data-access.txt">This</a> is the code you should put in it.
			</p>
			<p>
			Study this code (maybe I should have forced you to copy it from a screen shot)!
			If you don't understand any of it, please ask questions in class. 
			Here are some things for you to note:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					There is no closing php tag (<b>?&gt;</b>) because this is an include file.		
				</li>
				<li>
					The constructor function takes a link to the database as a param.
					This param is used to set the <b>$link</b> instance variable.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <b>getPageList()</b> method has an optional parameter which defaults to true.
					If this parameter is true, then a WHERE clause is added to the SQL query that the method executes. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The MySQL <b>DATE_FORMAT()</b> function is used to change how the publishedDate column is formatted.
					Remember that MySQL requires dates to be formatted as <b>yyyy-mm-dd</b>, but we want to present dates on the website as <b>mm/dd/yyyy</b> (the second parameter passed into DATE_FORMAT() is a little strange, you can ask me about it in class).
				</li>
				<li>
					When <b>mysqli_query()</b> is executed, we use the <b>OR</b> keyword to call the handleError() method if the query fails (the handleError() method is defined in the PageDataAccess class).
					This is a much better approach than simply calling die() as the book does (when you die, your dead).
					By using handleError() we can do things such as logging the error and redirecting to our friendly error page.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
			We will test this code in the next page that we create.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a new folder called <b>tests</b> and put it inside the <b>my-new-site</b> folder.
		</li>
		<li>
			Inside the tests folder, create a file named <b>page-data-access-tests.php</b>
			Then put <a href="screen-shots/4-test-page.png">this</a> code into the page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open the <b>page-data-access-tests.php</b> page in the browser, and make sure it's properly fetching the data from the database.
			Now we have the confidence to know that our data access code is working properly before we use it in the blog home page.
			This is a very crude form of <b>unit testing</b>.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Hooking up the Blog Home Page</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Open the blog home page (blog/index.php)</li>
		<li>Add <a href="screen-shots/5-use-page-data-access-in-blog-home-page.png">this</a> code just under the link to the config file.</li>
		<li>
			Add <a href="create-blog-list.txt">this</a> function to the bottom of the page (but before the closing php delimiter).
			<br>Study the function, make sure you understand its parameter, its return value, and the code inside it.	
		</li>
		<li>
			Finally, let's invoke the function we just created and echo out the html string that it returns.
			The PHP code should go just under the the H1 tag on the page.
			You can remove the P tag that is currently under the H1 tag.
			Your code should look like <a href="screen-shots/7-calling-createBlogList.png">this</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open the blog home page in the browser.
			Note that the blog post title is a hyperlink to a page that we have not yet created.
			We'll create that page in the next step of the project.
			Also note that the html code generated by createBlogList() includes links that have query string variables in the URL. The variable is named <b>pageId</b> and it's value is the associated blog post id in the pages table.  
			Finally, note that URL query string variables are also called <b>url parameters</b>.
		</li>
